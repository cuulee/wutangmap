# wutangmap

This is just a fun map in leaflet.js about the geographical locations mentioned in Wu Tang Clan lyrics. All of the data was compiled by myself, analyzing lyrics in all 218 songs. I use some discretion for determining whether a location is being used as an adjective or referring to the location itself.
